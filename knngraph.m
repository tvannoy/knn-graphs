function G = knngraph(X, k, options)
%KNNGRAPH Construct a k-nearest neighbors graph
%   G = KNNGRAPH(X, k) constructs a k-nearest neighbors directed graph, G,
%   for the input data matrix X. Rows in X are observations, and columns are
%   variables. The distance metric used is the Euclidean distance.
%
%   G = KNNGRAPH(neighbors, k, 'Precomputed', true) takes a precomputed nearest
%   neighbors index as an argument instead of the original data matrix. This is
%   useful when creating several knngraphs for the same data with different
%   values of k, as the nearest neighbors index only needs to be computed once.
%   The number of columns in neighbors must be >= k + 1  because KNNGRAPH does
%   not include self-edges, but the nearest neighbors index does. k can be much
%   less than the number of columns in neighbors.
%
%   G = KNNGRAPH(X, k, 'Method', method) constructs a k-nearest neighbors graph
%   using the specified method.
%
%   Optional parameters:
%   'Method'        - The method to use when building the knn index
%       "knnsearch" - Use KNNSEARCH from Mathwork's Statistics and Machine
%                     Learning Toolbox. This is the default method.
%       "nndescent" - Use the nearest neighbor descent algorithm to build an
%                     approximate knn index. For large matrices, this is
%                     much faster than KNNSEARCH, at the cost of slightly
%                     less accuracy. This method requires the pynndescent
%                     python package to be installed and accessible through
%                     MATLAB's Python external language interface
%
%   'Precomputed'   - Needs to be true if using a precomputed nearest neighbors
%                     index. The default is false.
