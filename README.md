MATLAB functions for creating k-nearest neighbor (knn) graphs. 

Many machine learning and data mining algorithms use k-nearest neighbor graphs. While MATLAB provides graph/digraph objects, it does not provide any high-level functions to create k-nearest neighbor graphs. The functions in this repo provide constructors for various k-nearest-neighbor-type graphs, which are returned as native MATLAB graph objects. 

Available graph types:
- k-nearest neighbor (`knngraph`)
- mutual k-nearest neighbor (`mutualknngraph`)

## Performance considerations
The most expensive part of knn graph creation is the knn search. In a lot of cases, MATLAB's [knnsearch](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/knnsearch.html) function performs an exhaustive search, which has a complexity of O(n^2) and is very time-consuming for large data. 

The functions in this repo provide the option of using [pynndescent](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent), an approximate knn search, to speed things up. `pynndescent` is used through MATLAB's Python language interface. There is now a [MATLAB implementation of NN-descent](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/84535-nearest-neighbor-descent-nn-descent), but there was a memory leak when I last tried to use it.

## Dependencies
- Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox

#### Optional
If you want to perform a fast approximate knn search, you will need [pynndescent](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent) installed. 

Refer to [Mathworks' documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html) on setting up the Python language interface. You will need to use a Python version that your version of MATLAB supports. I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) on Linux; it can be used on Windows as well, but, in my experience, it is not trivial to get MATLAB to recognize your Anaconda environment on Windows.

## Usage
Creating a 10-nearest neighbor graph on random data:
```matlab
X = rand(50e3, 20);
G = knngraph(X, 10);
```

Creating a mutual 5-nearest neighbor graph on random data:
```matlab
X = rand(50e3, 20);
G = mutualknngraph(X, 5);
```

Precomputing the knn search for 10 neighbors:
```matlab
X = rand(50e3, 20);

% by default, knn index creation includes self-edges, so use k+1
neighbors = knnindex(X, 11);

% create 10-nearest neighbor graph
G10 = knngraph(neighbors, 10);

% create 4-nearest neighbor graph without recomputing the knn search
G4 = knngraph(neighbors, 4);
```
Since computing the knn index is the most expensive operation, precomputing it can save time if you need to build multiple graphs.
