function neighbors = knnindex(X, k, options)
%KNNINDEX Compute k-nearest neighbors index on input data
%   neighbors = KNNINDEX(X, k) constructs a k-nearest neighbors index matrix, 
%   neighbors, for the input data matrix X. X is an M-by-d matrix of M
%   d-dimensional observations. neighbors is an M-by-k matrix, where each
%   row i contains the indices of the k-nearest neighbors of point i. Point
%   i is included in it's k-nearest neighbors list. 
%
%   neighbors = KNNINDEX(X, k, 'Method', method) constructs a k-nearest 
%   neighbors index for the input data X using the specified method.
%  
%   Optional parameters:
%   'Method'        - The method to use when building the knn index
%       "knnsearch" - Use KNNSEARCH from Mathwork's Statistics and Machine
%                     Learning Toolbox. This is the default method.
%       "nndescent" - Use the nearest neighbor descent algorithm to build an
%                     approximate knn index. For large matrices, this is
%                     much faster than KNNSEARCH, at the cost of slightly
%                     less accuracy. This method requires the pynndescent
%                     python package to be installed and accessible through
%                     MATLAB's Python external language interfacea
